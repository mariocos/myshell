Hello, this is my minishell project!

/*redirections*/
/*------------*/
In this project redirections are implemented in a very simple way.
>[outfile] , <[infile] , <<[heredoc].
Theese redirections are handled similiar to bash but with alot of limitations.
The most important of wich are the inability to specify redirections from an fd to another.

/*  tokens   */
/*-----------*/
The tokenization of the input is done in two parts,
Firstly the input is tokanized by separating through spaces and initial token type assignement.
Secondly the initial tokens are re-parsed to separate "words" from operators.
(this is done in order to preserve the lack of spaces so things like ->"hey"hey"" is interpreted as "heyhey" without a space)

The token struct is a doubly linked list containing the following content:
(int)t_token->token_type;
(char *)t_token->token;
(int)t_token->index;

E.g:
"echo "hey"hello>test.txt|cat test.txt"
Part 1
token 1:[echo], token 2:["hey"hello>test.txt|cat], token 3:[test.txt]
Part 2
token 1:[echo] token 2:["hey"hello], token 3:[>] token 4:[test.txt], token 5:[|], token 6:[cat], token 7:[test.txt]
